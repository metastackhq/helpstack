# Understanding Workspaces
---

Metastack uses **Workspaces** to organize strategies, lineups, and team resources.  
A workspace is like a container for all your Counter-Strike 2 content.  
You can be a member of multiple workspaces - just like in Slack, Notion, etc.

## Types of Workspaces

1. Personal Workspace
   - Automatically created when you sign up.  
   - Only visible to you.  
   - A place to experiment, create drafts, and test ideas freely.  
   - Everything can be **personalized** to the your needs.  
   - No permissions or restrictions - you are the owner.  

2. Team Workspaces
   - Created from the **workspace switcher** in the top-right corner.  
   - Visible to all team members.  
   - Everything can be **personalized** to the team’s needs.  
   - You may have limited permissions depending on your rank in the team. 

## Content Personalization

Each team can customize their workspace:
- **Nades** - when importing/creating.
- **Strategies** - when importing/creating.
- **Callouts** - team-specific names for map locations.  
- **Keywords** - shared terms that describe in-game events.  
- **Tables, Playbooks, Lineups, Roles** – all tailored to how your team plays.  

Whenever you browse the **Metastack Content Library**, content is automatically shown with the **current team’s personalized terms**.  

## Switching Between Workspaces

- You can be a member of multiple teams (workspaces).  
- To switch workspaces:
  1. Open the **workspace switcher** in the top-right corner.  
  2. Select the team or your personal workspace from the dropdown.  
  3. The sidebar and content area will update to show that workspace’s resources.  

## Creating New Workspaces

- You can create additional workspaces (teams) at any time.  
- When creating a new workspace, you will be its **owner**.  
- As owner, you can invite members, define permissions, and set up personalized terms.  

## Summary

- Workspaces = Teams (or your personal space).
- Each workspace has its own **Playbooks, Lineups, Tables, Roles, Callouts, and Keywords**.  
- Your personal workspace is private.
- Team workspaces depend on permissions.
- Switching between workspaces is quick using the **top-right dropdown**.
- You can always create new team workspaces.
