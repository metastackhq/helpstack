# Metastack
---

**Metastack** is an **esports software tool**, made specifically for **Counter-Strike**.  
It allows players to:
- Efficiently **create and organize** their own game knowledge  
- Quickly **discover and import new tactical content** from a massive content library  
- Do it all within a **single unified platform**  

## Vision

Metastack is starting out with this one tool, with a plan to **evolve into a complete suite of tools**, with a goal to bring everything that Counter-Strike players are using into **one integrated platform**.  

It’s a **completely new type of tool** on the market - there is nothing else like it right now.  
This is a **big project**, in development for **over 2 years**, with many super talented developers working on it.  

## Origins

Metastack is created by **Feed**, the ex-strategic coach of **Heroic**.  
He is personally designing the entire platform, with the goal of solving the **real problems Counter-Strike players face daily**.  
This is the reason why he left HEROIC and professional CS - to commit to **Metastack full time**.  

## Special Collaboration

We are the **only Counter-Strike platform in the world** working together with **Minh “Gooseman” Le**, the **creator of Counter-Strike**.  
He has been with us since **January**, and has been **super helpful** in shaping the platform.  

## Free to Use

The platform is **free to use now**, will remain free **after launch**, and we will keep it free **for as long as possible**.
