# How Statuses Work
---

Statuses represent the current state of a strat or nade, helping you organize, sort, and filter your playbook effectively.

---

### Available Statuses

- **Active** - Ready for use in matches and practice. This is your go-to content.
- **For Practice** - Needs more practice before it can be reliably executed in matches.
- **Draft** - Still being defined or worked on. Use this for ideas and incomplete setups.
- **For Review** - Awaiting approval or feedback from teammates or coaches before moving to active.
- **Archived** - No longer in use, but kept for reference or historical purposes.

---

### How Archived Content Works

Archived strats and nades are treated differently from other statuses:

- **Can be linked** - You can still reference archived content using slash commands.
- **Can be added to Tables** - Archived items can be manually added to your Tables view.
- **Hidden by default** - Archived content will **not** appear in your Playbook, Lineups, or Roles views unless you explicitly filter to show archived items.

This keeps your active playbook clean while preserving access to older content when you need it.

### Best Practices

- Move outdated strats to **Archived** instead of deleting them-you might want to revisit them later.
- Use **For Review** when collaborating with your team to ensure everyone approves before marking something as **Active**.
- Keep **Draft** strats separate until they're tested and refined.
