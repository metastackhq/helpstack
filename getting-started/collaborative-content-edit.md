# Collaborative Content Edit
---

When editing Strat, Nade, or Keyword content, our collaborative editing system ensures that multiple users can work safely without overwriting each other's changes.

## How It Works

### Available for Editing
When no one else is currently editing the content, you will be able to start editing immediately.

### Locked State
If someone is already editing the same content, you will enter a locked state where you cannot make changes. In this state, you will see:

- An avatar preview of the person currently editing
- If multiple people are editing, you'll see a few avatars plus a number indicating how many additional people are involved

## Your Options When Content is Locked

When content is locked, you have two choices:

1. **Wait for your turn** - Stay on the page and wait until your turn
2. **Leave** - Navigate away and return later when the content might be available

## Benefits

This collaborative editing system prevents:
- Unintentional edits that could overwrite other people's work
- Conflicts between multiple editors
- Loss of important changes due to simultaneous editing

The system ensures that everyone's contributions are preserved and that editing happens in an orderly, conflict-free manner.
