The Playbook is the central hub where you can **create, store, organize, filter, import and search** strategies for your team. 
It helps you structure your game plan and ensures consistency across matches.  

## Strat Details
Each strat contains a rich set of details to make it as descriptive and reusable as possible:

### Tags

### Area

## Creating a Strategy
To create a new strategy:  
1. Navigate to the Playbook.  
2. Click the **+ Create** button in the top-right corner.  
3. Select **New Strat**.  


### Strategy Roles
Each strategy can define **Strategy Roles**. Strategy Roles describe what each player should do during the execution:  
- Assigned **weapon**.  
- Choosing type of **Strategy Role**.
   - Positional
   - Spawn based
   - Custom (enter name you wish)
- Write description of the exact role duty, timing and coordination details.  
- Mention **nades**, **other strats**, **keywords", **callouts** from your team's workspace.  


This makes it easy to reuse, adapt, and reference strategies across the team’s entire tactical framework.
