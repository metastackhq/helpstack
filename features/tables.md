# Tables
---

**Tables** are like Google Sheets - but enhanced for Counter-Strike strategy management.  
They allow your team to organize, plan, and quickly access strategies in a familiar tabular format.  

## Navigating Tables
- On the **left side**, use the dropdown to select which table you want to work on.  
- You can also **create a new table** from the same dropdown.  
- Select the **side** (Terrorist or Counter-Terrorist) on the left panel.  
- At the **top of the table**, choose the **map** you want to work on.  

## Table Structure
Each table is automatically structured with **strategy types** as column headers.  
This means every column represents a type of strategy (e.g., *Set Round, Play, Opening*), making it easy to categorize.  

## Adding Strategies
To fill a table cell with a strategy:  
1. Make sure youâ€™ve selected a **map** and **side**.  
2. Navigate to the appropriate **strategy type column**.  
3. Start typing the name of the strategy (e.g., typing `B Slow` under **Play** on *Dust2*, CT side).  
4. A dropdown will appear showing all matching strategies from your **Playbook** that match:  
   - The selected **map**.  
   - The selected **side**.  
   - The selected **strategy type**.  

### Fast Create
If no existing strategy matches your input, you can **quick-create a new strategy** directly from the table:  
- The new strategy will be created with the name you entered.  
- All other attributes (map, side, type) will be **inherited from the current table selections**.  

## Using Tables
- Once strategies are filled into the table, you can **preview them directly**.  
- Each entry is **linked to the strategy from your Playbook**, so you can quickly navigate and open the strategy page.  
- This makes Tables a powerful hub for **planning scrims, practices, and official matches**.  

## Summary 
- Organize strategies in a structured, spreadsheet-like view.  
- Quickly search, filter, and insert existing strategies.  
- Create new strategies seamlessly without leaving the table.  
- One-click preview and navigation to full strategy details.
