## Creating Lineups

1. Click **+ Create** button in the top-right corner.  
2. Select **New Nade** from the dropdown.
3. Provide details for the nade:
   - Map 
   - Side 
   - Type
   - Name
:::info
All other fields are completely optional. You can choose to fill them or leave empty.
Filling other fields would make searching and filtering through lineups easier.
:::
4. Save it to your lineups.  

Your nade will now appear inside your personal or team lineup collection, depending on the active workspace.

## Using the Metastack Lineups

Instead of creating everything from scratch, you can import nades from the **Metastack Content Library**:

1. When inside **Lineups**, locate the **dropdown** in the main content area.  
2. Switch from **[Your/Team's] Lineups** to **Metastack Lineups**.  
3. Browse available nade setups provided by Metastack.  
4. Import and start personalizing!

## Personalization

All imported nades can be adapted to your team’s needs:
- Use your **custom callouts**. (When importing this is done by default!)
- Personalize **Name** for easier memorization.  
- Add or remove images, set your custom coordinates and much more.

## Summary

- Lineups are collections of nade setups.  
- You can create your own or import from the **Metastack Lineups**.  
- Switching between **[Your/Team's] Lineups** and **Metastack Lineups** is done via the **dropdown** in the main content area.  
- Imported nades can be fully personalized to match your team’s language and style.
