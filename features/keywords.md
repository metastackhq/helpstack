# Keywords
---

**Keywords** are short terms or phrases that describe entire in-game situations.  
They are used by professional players to simplify communication and ensure quick decision-making during matches.  

For example:  
- **Freeze** - all players hold their current positions, avoid using utility, and focus only on shooting.  

## Creating Keywords
You can add keywords in two ways:  
- **Import from Metastack** – use predefined, commonly used professional terms.  
- **Create your own** – define team-specific keywords tailored to your playstyle.  

## Managing Keywords
Keywords can be:  
- **Filtered** by:  
  - **Side** – Terrorist or Counter-Terrorist.  
  - **Tags** – custom labels for better organization.  
  - **Status** – Active, Draft, Archived, etc.  
- **Searched** by name.  
- **Sorted** by:  
  - Date Added  
  - Date Edited  
  - Name
