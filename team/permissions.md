## Rank Descriptions
- **Owner** – creator of the team; full permissions, cannot be removed.  
- **Admin** – trusted members with management and content rights.  
- **Member** – active contributors; focus on creating, editing, and using team content.  
- **Viewer** – observers with read-only access.  

## Best Practices
- Assign **Admin** roles sparingly to ensure security.  
- Use **Viewers** for analysts, trial members, or external collaborators.  
- Keep rank updated as your team structure evolves.
