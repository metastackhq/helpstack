# Sharing
---

Sharing is one of the most powerful features of Metastack.  
It allows players and teams to **connect, collaborate, and understand each other**, no matter what language they speak or what team they belong to.

## Sharing Inside Your Team

When you are in the **same team**, sharing is simple:  
just share the entity you want – whether it’s a **Strat, a Nade, or a Keyword**.  
Your teammates instantly see it in their workspace.

## Sharing Across Teams

When you are part of **different teams**, you can share **Metastack entities**.  

- If someone shares a Metastack entity with you, you can open it and:  
  - **View the original version** - Metastack's
  - **See your own imported version** (if you have it imported)

This system ensures that **everyone is referring to the same entity**, even if they customize it.

## Breaking the Language Barrier

This approach makes sharing on Metastack uniquely powerful:  

- One player can import a Metastack entity and **rewrite it in their native language**.  
- Another player can import the same entity and do the same in a **completely different language**.  
- Yet, both are looking at the **same entity**, the same tactical concept, the same meaning.

Metastack becomes a **universal language for strategy and communication**.  
Teams and players across the world can **share knowledge without friction**.

## The Future of Sharing

We are working on enabling **sharing from your personal team**.  
This will let you easily share your personal strategies and ideas with others,  
making collaboration even more natural and borderless.
