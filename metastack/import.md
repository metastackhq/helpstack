# Import
---

Metastack comes with a **huge content library** of Strats, Nades, and Keywords.  
These entities are created and maintained by experienced players and can be used as-is,  
or **adapted to perfectly fit your teamâ€™s style**.

## How Import Works

- Browse the **Metastack Playbook**, **Lineups**, or **Keywords**  
- Choose the entity you want to use  
- Click **Import**  
- The entity is now available in your team or personal workspace

## Your Choice: Use or Adapt

- **Use as-is**  
  Take advantage of the proven knowledge directly from Metastack.

- **Adapt to your needs**  
  Adjust names, details, or attributes to fit your language, playstyle, and team identity.  

This flexibility lets you **learn from the best** while still keeping your strategies unique.
